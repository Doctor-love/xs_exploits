# xs_exploits
#### Gently packaged Cross-Site exploits


## Introduction
"xs_exploits" is an attempt to develop a standardized format for packaging Cross-Site exploits/attacks, such as XSS, CSRF, CSWH and similar.  
The packaged exploits, called exploit modules, could be be used by an attack tool such as [kkross](https://github.com/doctor-love/kkross).  
  
The purpose of this repository is to document the packaging format and act as collaborative collection of exploit modules.  


## TL;DR example

  # Settings that can/must be configured by user before rendering of module
  # Certain options may be inherited from module_type - such as "HOST", "PROTO" and "PORT"

      # Specifies different types of limitations for the module option
      constraints:
        - constraint_type: length
          options:
            max: 25

  # Template for module redering (based on Jinja2)
  template: '{{ PROTO }}://{{ HOST }}:{{ PORT }}/actions/adduser.php?role=admin&email={{ EMAIL | urlencode }}'
  
  # Template for generating instance ID of module (based on Jinja2)
  # Defines the unique name of configured module in instance, in order to allow multiple use
  instance_id: '{{ PROTO }}://{{ HOST }}:{{ PORT }} - E: {{ EMAIL }}'
